# Spacehack Beaglebone Black Cape

A cape for the Beaglebone blacks that go in the consoles. It's going to have a small number of components and all the connectors required to run things in the consoles.


It uses the FlyingBone libraries and they are added as a submodule run 'git submodule --init update'
